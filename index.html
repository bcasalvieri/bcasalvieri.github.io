        <h2 class="red-text text-accent-2">Hi, I’m Brad! I’m a Full Stack Web Developer who is passionate about creating beautiful and meaningful websites and applications.</h2>
        <p>My journey to becoming a web developer was a circuitous one that unbeknownst to me began over a decade ago. Growing up I wanted to be a doctor. I attended the University of Delaware (Go Blue Hens!) graduating a semester early with a BS in Exercise Science while also completing the pre-med track. After finishing classes, I took the next month to travel to Cape Town, South Africa, for a mission trip. It was there that I came to see true beauty reflected in the colorful, vibrant sunsets, exotic animals, and the stories of the diverse people I encountered, and knew I would only be satisfied pursuing beauty and a genuine connection with others daily. Furthermore, through running an after school club for impoverished children and teens in Capricorn and fixing up a job training facility for unemployed women in Masiphumelele, I uncovered a strong desire to get my hands dirty making a difference in the lives of others. People matter, and loving people matters most of all. Upon returning home, I knew that med school was no longer my passion, and instead I packed my belongings into my Honda Civic, headed to warmer weather (I was eager to put the snow in my rearview mirror), and went to work as a missionary for a mentoring ministry, then as an educator and coach. After several fulfilling and joyful years, my journey led me to trade in my gradebook for a laptop at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to begin a new career as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
        <p>What else do you need to know about me?</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I believe there is nothing more contrary to our human nature than to be alone, and thus I strive to connect people. I also believe in treating others with mercy and compassion, so much so I tattooed a reminder on my wrist.</li>
          <li>I am a football junkie who played for thirteen years. Besides low-back pain, the countless hours of workouts, practices, and games strengthened my natural leadership skills, developed a passion for utilizing teamwork and innovation to solve complex problems, and instilled discipline, perseverance, and work ethic.</li>
          <li>I am a self-proclaimed nerd who believes learning and self discovery are continuous, lifelong, and rewarding ventures. I am a huge fan of podcasts, TED talks, self improvement books, and the 12 Steps model. I welcome all recommendations!</li>
          <li>I have a severe coffee addiction. I must begin each day with two mugs of black coffee or else…</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I am excited to collaborate with others to expand my personal knowledge of web development and to create applications that are purposeful and impactful. Below you can check out a few of my most recent projects of which I am most proud that demonstrates my skills as a developer.</p>
