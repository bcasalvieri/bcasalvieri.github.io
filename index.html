        <h2 class="red-text text-accent-1">Hi, I'm Brad! I am a full stack web developer and proud New Jerseyan.</h2>
        <p>My journey to become a developer was a circuitous one. I attended the University of Delaware (Go Blue Hens!) graduating in 3.5 years with a BS in Exercise Science while also completing a pre-med track. After graduation, I decided to take a break from school, packed my belongings into my Honda Civic, and headed to warmer weather where I went to work as a missionary for a mentoring ministry, then later as an educator and coach. Desiring a change that allowed me to better utilize my creativity and trade in my gradebook, I enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to become a Full Stack Web Developer, and quickly discovered a passion for technology and creating beautiful, meaningful websites and applications.</p>
        <p>In college I was a member of the football team, which strengthened my natural born leadership skills, developed a passion for utilizing teamwork and innovation to solve complex problems, and instilled discipline, perseverance, and work ethic (though I loathe burpees to this day). Furthermore, I am a self-proclaimed nerd who has a passion for continuous learning and a proud Catholic Christian  with a strong desire to serve others. Lastly, and most importantly, I am a certified coffeeholic who must start each day with at least two cups of black coffee.</p>
        <p>I am excited to collaborate with others to expand my personal knowledge of web development and to create applications that are purposeful and impactful. Below you can check out a few of my most recent projects of which I am most proud that demonstrates my skills as a developer.</p>
