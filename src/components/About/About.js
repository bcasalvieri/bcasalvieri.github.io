            While creating a website on Wix, I became curious about how websites
            were really built under the hood using actual programming languages.
            I enrolled in online courses to learn the basics: HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. Since then, I haven‚Äôt been able to get enough as I‚Äôve
            expanded my knowledge into front end frameworks and libraries
            (React.js, Gatsby, and Next.js), back end development (Node.js and
            Express), databases, and cloud computing (Amazon Web Services).

            Currently, I'm exploring GraphQL and Apollo as an alternative to
            REST APIs, learning TypeScript, and getting more familiar with
            Next.js.

            <strong>I live in New Jersey.</strong> Most people consider it the
            armpit of America, but I call it home. Contrary to popular belief,
            it's called the Garden State for a reason.

            <strong>I love football üèà.</strong> I played football for 13 years,
            including at the University of Delaware. Also, I've been bred to be
            a Florida State Seminole since birth. #GoNoles #GoBlueHens

            <strong>When I'm not coding,</strong> I love to play golf üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I like
            to think I'm a good golfer, and it gives me a place to channel my
            competitive nature. I enjoy reading a good book üìñ (I'm open to
            recommendations!) or binging shows on Netflix (Schitt's Creek
            anyone), Hulu, or Prime Video. I am passionate about my Catholic
            faith and studying the Bible.
